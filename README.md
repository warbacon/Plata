# 🥈 Plata

**Plata** is an Actually Good PDF viewer — fast, clean, and focused.

> AG = **Actually Good**  
> Ag = **Plata** en español  
> Ergo, *Plata* is Actually Good. 🧠💥

## ✨ Features

- 🖼️ Built with [Qt](https://www.qt.io/) — modern UI, native performance
- 📄 Lightweight and efficient PDF rendering
- 🧠 Designed with simplicity and usability in mind
- 🛠️ Open source and hackable

## 🧪 Coming Soon

We're currently working on integrating [MuPDF](https://mupdf.com/) to power the backend PDF rendering engine.  
This will bring better performance, more accurate rendering, and potentially support for advanced features like:

- Text search and selection
- Annotations
- Interactive forms
- Improved font rendering

Stay tuned!
